| Lecture   |  Monday   | 11:45  - 13:15  |  S205  |


## Learning objectives

The course Large Language Model applications focuses on exploring and realizing the potential of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 from OpenAI) to automate various business tasks. In particular, we will investigate how LLMs can be used to automate routine tasks such as composing emails and creating reports. 

By the end of the semester, you will be able to use popular frameworks like Hugging Face, OpenAI Models, LangChain, Microsoft Kernel and Gradio to build LLM applications


## Where to get help

- If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! 
- Outside of class, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the Moodle course forum.
- Emails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. **If you email me, please include the name of our course in the subject line.** 

Check out the [Support](course-support.qmd) page for more resources.

## Textbooks

This course is mainly based on the following resources:



## Lectures

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.


## Teams

You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester.

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester.

Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team's overall mark.

You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. [Commits](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each project.

## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of this component: 

- [project](@sec-project)


### Project {#sec-project}

The purpose of the [project](project-description.qmd) is to build and present a LLM application. The project will be completed in **teams**.

More information about the project will be provided during the semester.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage      |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Documentation         | 10%             |
| Project               | 70%             |
| Presentation          | 20%             |


The final grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

All students must adhere to the academic integrity standard. Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;
-   I will act if the standard is compromised

Regardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.



### Late work policy

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. Here are the rules for late submissions:

Project tasks may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the project task is late.
