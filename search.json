Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.\nUnless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nAny recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Here are the rules for late submissions:\n\nHomeworks may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for homeworks.\nProject taks may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the project task is late.\n\nIf there are important circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de before the deadline."

You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the topics stated in the file.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report.

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nVisualizations\nThis section includes a profound description of your visualization selection and creation process (with regard to the topics covered in our course). Explain the reasoning for the type of visualization considered for the project. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final visualizaion by describing the selection process, variable transformations (if needed) and any other relevant considerations that were part of the creation process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe selection steps are appropriate for the data and (research) question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final visualization(s); the approach is clearly described in the report. The visualization selection process took into account the aspects covered in the course (law of proximity, …). If violations of optimal visualization conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nConclusion + recommended action\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your (research) question along with (statistical) arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.\nAny potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include your recommended action.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the visualization results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original (research) question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis. The recommended action is plausible/convincing and clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are similar formatted as the examples shown in this course.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project video deadline. You only need to email me if you have concerns. Otherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade."

Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n90%-100%: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n\n\nLate work policy\nProject assignments (see timeline) may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the project is late.\nBe sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps."
