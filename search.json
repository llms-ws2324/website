In particular, we will investigate how LLMs can be used to automate routine tasks such as composing emails and creating reports. However, you can also work on applications related to customers (e.g. customer service chatbot).\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to use popular frameworks like Hugging Face, OpenAI Models, LangChain, Microsoft Kernel and Gradio to build LLM applications"
